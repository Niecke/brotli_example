# Brotli Example in Python

This repository contains a sample flow of how to compress and decompress data using Brotli in Python. 

In [compress.py](https://github.com/Niecke/brotli_example/blob/main/compress.py) a random text is generated and written to a file once uncompressed and once compressed.

In [decompress.py](https://github.com/Niecke/brotli_example/blob/main/decompress.py) both files are read in again and after the compressed data has been decompressed with Brotli it is compared with the original data.
